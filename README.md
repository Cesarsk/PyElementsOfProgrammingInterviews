# Elements of Programming Interviews

This is my attempt at solving the exercises of Elements of Programming Interviews.

The exercises are solved in Python. My solutions are available in the folder

    my_solutions

the original solutions are available under

    original_solutions

You can execute them to check if they work. They leverage the EPI Judge program to check the correctness with hundreds of
test cases.
